=== Dependencies ===
To run, you will require:
    * python    - http://www.python.org/
        * python2.5
    * wxpython  - http://www.wxpython.org/
        * python-wxgtk2.8
    * pil       - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
        * python-imaging

You can install these with the following command on Debian/Ubuntu Linux:
    sudo apt-get install python2.5 python-wxgtk2.8 python-imaging

If helpful, the other wxpython dependencies are: libwxbase2.8-0 libwxgtk2.8-0

=== Image files ===
Images files are stored in the data/ directory. New images must be run through the normalize script before they can be used. You must run normalize.py for _all_ input images (including test files). To add new fonts, add them to the list at the top of imagedata.py in the function getFontList() and place the corresponding files in the data/ directory. It is recommended that you do not use spaces in the names.

normalize.py will normalize (in place) any files with the input font name for the letters A-F
    python normalize.py TimesNewRoman Arial
will normalize TimesNewRoman_A.png ... TimesNewRoman_F.png and Arial_A.png .. Arial_F.png

After normalization, you can move a test set out of the data/ directory so that the self-organizing map will not use them to train.

=== Running ===
You can run using
    make run
Or
    python main.py

Note that if you use make clean, you must use make run because the module data files (__init__.py) are generated by the Makefile.

=== GUI ===
The GUI was generated using wxglade. The wxglade project is gladeGui.wxg and requires wxglade to open it. However, this is not necessary for running the program.
